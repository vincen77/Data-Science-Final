 Instructions to get our code to run using a Windows OS:
 
    1. Please make sure to get python 3 installed.
    2. Next, please visit "https://jupyter.org/" and scroll down until you see "Jupyter Notebook: The Classic Notebook Interface."
    3. From here, download jupyter notebook. It should save where your python is installed. 
                                              (for me, this is "C:\Users\Vincent\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\Scripts")
    4. Next, run jupyter notebook inside your command promopt, typing "jupyter notebook."
    5. This should open up jupyter notebook in a local host url. Inside this local host, it should contain a "home" folder for you.
        (For me, this is my "C:\Users\Vincent" directory)
    6. download the provided ".ipynb" file titled "RandomForest Final.ipynb" as well as the attached ".csv" file titled "automobileEDA.csv" and save these files in the directory
    where your "Home" is for jupyter notebook.
    7. To insure the code is able to run, please be sure to download these following libraries for python and jupyter notebook:
          "pip install seaborn"
          "pip install pandas"
          "pip install -U scikit-learn"
          "pip install matplotlib"
          "pip install pydot"
          "pip install graphviz"
          (Most of these should be able to work without installation, however if this is not the case, please install them and, upon running the code (if errors are given) find
          the version needed to run it.)
          ((Versions I have/been using:
          pandas           : 1.5.1
          numpy            : 1.23.4
          pytz             : 2022.5
          dateutil         : 2.8.2
          setuptools       : 58.1.0
          pip              : 22.3.1
          jinja2           : 3.1.2
          IPython          : 8.5.0
          bs4              : 4.11.1
          matplotlib       : 3.6.2
          scipy            : 1.9.3 ))
     8. Once everything has downloaded and been dragged to the correct locations, please run the code! if errors occur when running, run each kernal ( "In [1]:" space) at a time
     to insure that the code is able to run the correct information given. Jupyter may sometimes give problems when running every kernal at once due to information not yet being called.
     
    For HADOOP code:
      We ran hadoop using the tutorial provided for "Windows 10 hadtoop tutorial" with eclipse. When trying to run the code, please follow the steps used from the tutorial
      and import our code into the HADOOP marven project. If dragging the file inside the workspace doesnt work, please copy it's contents and paste it into a empty ".java"
      file.
